# ToolCK
A set of customized functions to be used for data analysis in Julia (VERSION: 1.0.3).

These are usually functions seen in Matlab but have no prosence in Julia. This repo is set up to fill this gap. Therefore, most of the functions here emulate functions in Matlab with the same name and almost the same usage.

For installation, use Pkg.clone("https://github.com/Cannaxuan/ToolCK.git")
